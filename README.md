## Game loop
The goal is to kill **10** monsters.

You first choose a class and that will set your starting stats and abilities - *Fighter*, *Ranger*, or *Mage*.
> On the bottom of the screen is your action bar - *Attack*, *Abilities*, and *Stats*.

Attack and kill enemies while managing your **Health** and **Magic** through *Abilities* and *Level Ups*.
> When you *Level Up* you're shown options to either **Increase Your Stats**, **Fully Heal**, or **Restore your shield**.
> As of now the shield only affects the **Fighter** and **Ranger** classes.
